## About us
The Pro SMP is a private Minecraft server for friends. The server was founded by Proxtious and MeesJ_ on March 23, 2021.

Things to keep in mind when contacting us:
- We do not provide any invites to our server (as mentioned above, you'll need a friend who is a member of our community to get an invite)
